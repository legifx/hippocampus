## Where M2 stands — read this first

M2 is being built in two halves. The first half is **meaning without models**: everything that
makes content searchable using no machine learning at all. The second half is the models. This
ordering is deliberate and follows the same discipline as M0 and M1 — if lexical search over
extracted content is not good, no embedding will rescue it, and the models are by far the
heaviest dependency in the project.

### Done, tested, and green (275 tests across the workspace)

**`cortex-extract`** — a new crate with three modules:

- `classify` — decides what a file is and whether it may be read. Magic bytes for binary
  formats; content sniffing for text, because plain text has no magic number; the extension is
  consulted **only** to choose between text handlers, never to decide readability. Enforces
  rule R1 (deny-list) and rule R3 (content roots) before anything opens a file.
- `extract` — bounded, lossy-decoding text extraction. Truncation is reported rather than
  silent, never cuts a character in half, and a byte-order mark is stripped.
- `chunk` — structure-aware chunking: Markdown at headings (not inside fenced blocks), code at
  top-level definitions, prose at paragraphs. Overlap of 15 %, BLAKE3 hash per chunk, byte
  offsets that address the original text exactly.

**Migration 0002** — rebuilds `chunks_fts` with `contentless_delete=1`, which is what lets a
contentless FTS index delete rows without being handed the original text back. Adds
`nodes.extract_state` and `nodes.extract_note`.

### Not done — and the first thing to notice

**`cortex-extract` is not called by anything.** It compiles, it is tested, and it is dead code.
Nothing extracts, nothing chunks, nothing writes to `chunks` or `chunks_fts`. The next session's
first job is to wire it in.

Remaining in the first half:

1. **Store operations for chunks.** Write chunks for a node, replace them when the file
   changes, delete them when it goes away, and keep `chunks_fts` in step. Must go through
   `Store::batch` — a document produces tens of chunks and the commit barrier dominates
   otherwise (see the M1 session log).
2. **The extraction stage in the ingest loop.** Idle-priority: extraction is the "replay" stage
   and must yield when the user is active. `nodes.extract_state` exists so the queue can be
   resumed rather than recomputed. The per-chunk hash is what makes a re-index cheap — a file
   whose content hash is unchanged must not be re-chunked at all.
3. **BM25 retrieval** over `chunks_fts`. Note that SQLite's `bm25()` returns *negative* scores,
   more negative being a better match. Getting that sign wrong inverts the ranking silently.
4. **RRF fusion** of the trigram path arm and the BM25 content arm, plus the salience boost, and
   the score breakdown that makes `cortex explain` possible. `ScoreBreakdown` already has the
   fields; nothing populates `lexical_rank` yet.
5. **Snippets.** Chunks store byte offsets and a bounded preview, not text (D16). A snippet
   longer than the preview is re-read from the file using the offsets.

Then the second half: the embedder (`multilingual-e5-small` via ONNX Runtime, D6), the usearch
vector index, the cross-encoder reranker, and the 50-query German/English goldset.

### Deferred, still outstanding from M1

- **The 24-hour soak test.** Deliberately deferred by the project owner. Everything it would
  guard is currently unguarded: a descriptor leak in the watcher, or unbounded growth in the
  coalescer, would not be caught by anything else.

### Decisions taken during M2 so far

- **Chunk size is measured in characters, not tokens.** The specification says 300–600 tokens.
  No tokenizer exists in the pipeline yet, and adding one purely to measure chunk sizes would
  tie chunking to a model choice not yet made. `TARGET_CHARS = 1600` lands inside the intended
  range at roughly 3.5–4 characters per token for a German/English mix. When the embedder
  arrives with its own tokenizer this becomes a token count; the resulting boundary shift is a
  re-index, which is a supported operation.
- **Code chunking is heuristic, not parsed.** The build prompt specifies tree-sitter. A grammar
  per language is one dependency per language, and the heuristic already captures the property
  that matters — a definition is not split from its signature. Tree-sitter remains the correct
  answer and is planned; this is a deliberate staging, not a silent descope.
- **PDF extraction is not implemented.** `Handling::Pdf` is recognised and classified but
  `has_text()` returns false for it, so such files are recorded and skipped. `pdf-extract` is
  available; this is the natural next extractor after the text path works end to end.

### A limitation worth knowing before writing the goldset

FTS5's `remove_diacritics 2` folds `ä` to `a`, so a query typed without umlauts matches. It does
**not** fold `ß` to `ss`, because ß carries no diacritic — it is a distinct letter. So "grosse"
does not find "große". There is a test asserting this gap so that it is recorded rather than
rediscovered as a recall mystery. Closing it needs either a custom tokenizer or query-side
expansion, and it will affect the German half of the M2 goldset.

### Things M1 deliberately left rough

- `Store` still wraps one connection behind a mutex, so queries serialise against ingest
  writes. Replace with a reader pool plus a single writer in M2, when extraction makes the
  writer busy enough for it to matter.
- The path index is rebuilt wholesale after any bulk change (reconcile, directory rename,
  directory removal). Correct and simple; if it ever shows up in a profile, patch incrementally
  instead — but only then.
- `assign_zones` runs one `UPDATE ... LIKE` per zone over the whole index. Linear in
  zones × nodes, which is why the zone budget exists. If zones ever need to be numerous, this
  is the thing to replace, not the budget.
- The ingest loop polls on a 250 ms timer rather than blocking on the inotify descriptor.
  Measured idle cost is 0.000 % of one core, so this is not worth changing without a reason.

## Environment (reference target)

Recorded because benchmark numbers are meaningless without it.

| | |
|---|---|
| Workstation OS | Ubuntu 26.04, Wayland, niri (scrollable tiling) |
| CPU | 10-core / 16-thread desktop class (i5-13400F) |
| RAM | 30 GB |
| GPU | RTX 5070 Ti, 16 GB, driver 595.x |
| Rust | 1.93.1 |
| Measured home directory | 78 621 files, 5 109 directories, 8.0 GB |
| Corpus bucket | 50 k–500 k (lower end) — local embeddings are comfortably realistic |

Note: the reference corpus for benchmarks is **synthetic and generated**, never the real home
directory. Benchmarks must be reproducible on a machine that has never seen this system.

## Decisions already made

See `02-DECISIONS.md` for the full log with reasoning. Summary of what is settled:

- Headless daemon core, all UIs are clients (D1)
- Brain first; full file manager is a committed milestone, not optional (D2)
- Rust daemon (D3)
- Tauri v2 + React + Framer Motion, provisional until M4 (D4)
- One SQLite file + FTS5 + usearch HNSW, provisional until M2 benchmarks (D5)
- `multilingual-e5-small` embeddings on the local GPU, never on a server (D6)
- No LLM in the hot search path, ever (D8)
- Two repositories: public Core, private Extension; extension loaded as a subprocess plugin (D9)
- The Core is fully functional with no Main Brain at all (D10)
- English code and docs, i18n UI defaulting to German (D12)
- Previews in a separate process, progressive, size-capped (D14)
- Zone colours derived deterministically, fixed saturation/lightness, never the only signal (D15)
- `inotify` rather than `fanotify`; the spec's mandate was measured and rejected (D20)
- Path search has two tiers; the full scan runs only when the literal search finds nothing (D21)

## Session log

Newest entry on top. One entry per working session. Keep entries short and factual — what
changed, what was learned, what the next agent needs to know.

### 2026-08-18 — M2 begun: the extraction layer

Stopped deliberately at a clean boundary so the next session has a well-defined starting point.
275 tests green, workspace builds, no daemon left running.

Built `cortex-extract` (classify, extract, chunk) and migration 0002. **None of it is wired
in** — see "Where M2 stands" at the top of this file for exactly what to do next and in what
order.

Three things worth knowing:

1. **"MIME by magic bytes, never by extension" is only half a rule.** Binary formats have magic
   numbers; plain text does not. There is no byte sequence meaning "this is Markdown". So the
   actual rule is: deny-list first, then magic number if present, then content sniffing to
   decide whether it is text at all, and only then the extension — used solely to pick which
   text handler runs. The extension can never make an unreadable file readable, and never
   overrides a magic number. A JPEG named `.txt` is a JPEG, and there is a test saying so.
2. **A byte budget must bound the read itself, not check the size afterwards.** `take()` on the
   reader means a file that grows while being read still cannot exceed the budget. Checking
   `metadata.len()` first would be a race.
3. **Slicing a string at a byte offset derived from arithmetic will panic sooner or later.** The
   chunker's hard-split searched for a line break inside `text[cursor..cursor + MAX_CHARS]`, and
   that endpoint is not a character boundary in German text. Caught by the test written for
   exactly that case. Every offset that reaches a slice now goes through `floor_char_boundary`.

### 2026-08-18 — M1: zones and the directory graph

The two structural gaps M1 left behind are closed. 225 tests green, every latency gate still
passing, RSS 150 MiB.

**Zones (D15).** `cortex_core::zones` derives a stable hue from a zone's path; detection lives
in `cortex_ingest::zone_detect`. Two sources qualify as a zone: conventional areas directly
under a configured root (`Documents`, `Projects`, `Pictures`, …) and project roots anywhere
within three levels, identified by markers like `.git` or `Cargo.toml`. The deepest containing
zone wins, so a repository inside `Documents` reads as that repository. Observable through
`cortex zones`, overridable with `cortex zones set-color`.

**The directory graph.** `parent_id` is populated: in bulk by `Store::link_parents` after a
reconcile, and directly on incremental inserts, where the parent is one cached lookup away.
`cortex node` now shows both parent and zone.

Three things worth knowing:

1. **A zone budget was necessary, and it is a real constraint rather than a safety valve.**
   Zone assignment costs one pass over the index *per zone*. The benchmark corpus produces 567
   candidates, because its generator scatters `.git` directories as noise and those are genuine
   project markers — the initial index went from 4.1 s to 7.1 s before the cap. Capped at 64 by
   default, with the drop logged. A real home directory is far below that; the corpus is the
   pathological case, which is exactly what it is for.
2. **Truncating to a budget needs a total order.** Sorting candidates by depth alone leaves ties
   to directory iteration order, so which zones survived the cap — and therefore every colour —
   could differ between runs on an unchanged tree. That defeats the entire premise of D15.
   Now sorted by depth, then path.
3. **Bulk assignment is for when the zone *set* changes, not when a file appears.** Re-running
   it per new directory would make creating a handful of folders take longer than the initial
   index. Incremental inserts read a cached zone list instead, and full re-detection is
   triggered only by a conventional directory name or a project-marker file appearing.

The `NodeUpsert` zone field distinguishes "no opinion" from "no zone": a bulk metadata refresh
passes `None` and the stored assignment is kept, because otherwise every size change would blank
the colour of the file that changed.

### 2026-08-17 — M1: perception

Three new crates (`cortex-query`, `cortex-ingest`, plus the `bench/` tooling), 92 → 185 tests,
all green. Every measurable M1 gate passes; three items remain and are listed at the top of
this file.

What exists now:

- **Reproducible benchmark corpus.** `bench/corpus/generate.sh` builds 100 000 indexable files
  plus 190 000 skippable ones from a fixed seed, with a hand-rolled PRNG so the corpus is
  byte-identical forever — a benchmark whose input can drift with a dependency version is not a
  benchmark.
- **Path index** (`cortex-query`): trigram postings over a single concatenated byte buffer,
  fzf-style scoring with smart case, tombstoned removal, compaction.
- **Watcher** (`cortex-ingest`): `inotify` with a watch budget and reported degradation.
- **Coalescer**: clock-free and filesystem-free, so every timing rule is tested exactly rather
  than with sleeps.
- **Reconciliation**: two-pass, rename-aware, batched.
- Daemon integration, plus `cortex watch status` and `cortex reconcile`.

Four things worth knowing that cost real time:

1. **Renaming a directory deleted its subtree from the index.** `IN_MOVE_SELF` fires on the
   moved directory's *own* watch in addition to the parent's `IN_MOVED_FROM`/`IN_MOVED_TO` pair.
   It carries no destination, so it was mapped to a deletion — and a deletion supersedes a
   pending rename in the coalescer. Net effect: a rename erased the subtree. Fixed by dropping
   `IN_MOVE_SELF` from the watch mask entirely; the parent's pair is exact and reconciliation
   covers the case where the parent is not watched. Regression test added.
2. **Reconciliation had to be two passes.** Resolving renames in the same loop that handles
   adds and removals means a directory rename rewrites its descendants' paths while the loop is
   still holding the pre-rename map. The stale entries it then tried to move clobbered the rows
   the first move had just written. Renames are now resolved first, against a snapshot, and the
   index is re-read before anything else runs. `rename_node` additionally refuses to act when
   its source is absent, so a stale caller can no longer delete a good row.
3. **My own measurement script was wrong, twice.** `grep '"files":[0-9]*'` never matches
   pretty-printed JSON, because there is a space after the colon — so the polling loop always
   ran to its timeout and I read 240 s and then 132 s as index times. The daemon log had the
   real number all along: **4.07 s**. Parse JSON with a JSON parser. Do not trust a timing
   number that comes from a shell loop you wrote in the same breath as the thing it measures.
4. **Sorting, not matching, dominated the keystroke path.** A one-character query matches
   nearly every path, and fully sorting 100 000 candidates to display 50 cost more than finding
   them. `select_nth_unstable_by` plus a parallel scan took the P95 from 21 ms to 4.75 ms.

### 2026-08-17 — M0 implemented and accepted

Five crates, 92 tests, all green. Every M0 acceptance criterion verified by hand as well as by
test — the numbers are in the benchmark table below.

What exists now:

- `cortex-core` — config (layered, validating, safe by default), paths (XDG, `0700`/`0600`),
  domain model, ID newtypes, and the **deny-list**. The deny-list landed early rather than in
  M1 because rule R1 is not something to retrofit.
- `cortex-store` — the full schema as migration `0001`, a forward-only migration runner that
  refuses a database from a newer build, and the M0 query surface.
- `cortex-rpc` — JSON-RPC 2.0 types with the version enforced at the type level, newline-delimited
  JSON framing, and a client used by every other component.
- `cortexd` — lifecycle, `flock`-based single-instance lock, socket at `0600`, signal handling,
  metadata walker.
- `cortex-cli` — `ping`, `status`, `search`, `index`, `node`, `episodes`, `shutdown`, each with
  `--json`.

Two things worth knowing that cost time:

1. **Partial unique indexes need their `WHERE` clause repeated in `ON CONFLICT`.** The index on
   `nodes(path)` is partial because concept and annotation nodes have no path. Without repeating
   the predicate, every upsert failed with "ON CONFLICT clause does not match any PRIMARY KEY or
   UNIQUE constraint" — and because the walker treats an upsert failure as a skip, it looked
   like an over-eager deny-list rather than a SQL bug. If indexing silently skips everything,
   check the SQL before the classifier.
2. **The hygiene gate caught our own test fixtures**, which used made-up single-letter home
   directories instead of the documented placeholder. Fixed the fixtures rather than widening
   the exemption list. Keep resolving it in that order — the gate is only worth having while
   it is stricter than we are.

### 2026-08-17 — Planning and documentation

- Read the source specification (`docs/99-SOURCE-SPEC.md`) and answered its §16 open questions
  with the project owner. Answers recorded as D2, D10, D12.
- Measured the real corpus: 78 621 files / 8.0 GB. This is the low end of the 50 k–500 k bucket
  and it is what makes local embedding and a single SQLite file the right call (D5, D6).
- Extracted the `island-ui` design system into `06-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`: tokens, geometry scale,
  named springs, timing constants, layer model. This is what makes D4 (web-based GUI) the
  cheaper option — the motion system already exists in React + Framer Motion.
- Established the documentation set: glossary, build prompt, decision log, architecture,
  hard rules, design system, this file.
- Created the two repositories: public Core and private Extension.
- Consulted an agent on the owner's home server about the Main Brain and the federation path.
  Findings are recorded in the **private** Extension repository, not here — the public Core
  must contain nothing about a specific peer (§R9).
- Verified the toolchain: Rust 1.93.1, cargo can fetch crates.

**Key correction to the source spec discovered during the survey:** the spec suggests offloading
expensive model work to the home server. The survey showed the server has **no GPU**, 15 GB RAM
and roughly thirty always-on services, while the workstation has a 16 GB RTX-class GPU. The
direction is therefore reversed — embeddings and reranking stay local. Recorded as D6.

Path-search figures come from `bench-latency` against the standard corpus, release build.
Index, CPU and memory figures are from a live daemon; the index time is taken from the
daemon's own log rather than from an external poller.

Measured with a **debug** build; the release build will be faster. These are hand-timed runs,
not yet a benchmark harness — M1 must replace them with `bench/` so they become a CI gate
rather than a note.

### M0 acceptance, verified

| Cold start under 200 ms | 12–23 ms |
| `kill -9` mid-flight, restart, consistent database | yes — index intact, search works, no corruption |
| Second daemon refused with a clear message | yes — names the lock file and the holding pid |
| Works with no config file and no state directory | yes — creates both, safe defaults |
| Deny-list holds end to end | yes — `.ssh`, `id_ed25519`, `.env` and `node_modules` absent from the index |
